## Eric McGee Solution

This app was build under the instructions / requirements from our client Publicis Sapient. The app is functioning as intended, however I've added an onChange method for steps. This allows us to debug more effencially in case an object is modified.

## Testing

I used Jest and Enzyme to test the components.

## Notes

Add meaningful validations to your steps..

Write and tests using my favorite testing framework..
